To prepare, first marinate 500g of boneless chicken in a mixture of yogurt, 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste, 1 tablespoon red chili powder, 1 teaspoon turmeric, and salt. Let it sit for at least 1 hour. In a hot pan, grill the marinated chicken until slightly charred, then set it aside. In the same pan, heat butter and sauté chopped onions, ginger, garlic, and green chilies until golden. Add 2-3 chopped tomatoes and cook until soft. Blend this mixture into a smooth puree. Return it to the pan, add 1 tablespoon of garam masala, 1 tablespoon of cumin powder, and 1 tablespoon of red chili powder. Pour in cream and a little water to create a thick sauce. Add the grilled chicken pieces, mix well, and simmer for 10 minutes. Garnish with fresh cream and coriander leaves, and serve hot with naan or rice.';

To prepare, start by blanching a bunch of spinach leaves in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then transfer them to ice water to retain their vibrant green color. Blend the spinach into a smooth puree and set aside. In a pan, heat oil and sauté cumin seeds, chopped onions, ginger, garlic, and green chilies until golden. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until soft. Stir in 1 teaspoon of turmeric, 1 teaspoon of cumin powder, and 1 teaspoon of garam masala. Add the spinach puree and cook for a few minutes. Cube 200g of paneer and lightly fry or add it directly into the spinach gravy. Stir gently and cook for another 5 minutes, adjusting salt and consistency as needed.
