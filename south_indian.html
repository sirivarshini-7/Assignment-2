To prepare it, start by soaking 2 cups of rice and 1 cup of urad dal separately for 4-6 hours. After soaking, grind them together to form a smooth batter, adding water as needed. Allow the batter to ferment overnight or for 8-12 hours in a warm place until it doubles in size. Once fermented, mix the batter well and add salt to taste. Heat a non-stick pan or a griddle, pour a ladle of batter, and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin crepe. Drizzle a little oil around the edges and cook until golden brown and crispy. Flip and cook the other side for a minute if needed. Serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar.';

To prepare idli, soak 2 cups of rice and 1 cup of urad dal (split black gram) separately for 4-6 hours. Once soaked, grind the urad dal into a smooth paste, then grind the rice into a coarse paste, adding water as needed. Combine both pastes to form a batter, add salt, and let it ferment overnight or for 8-12 hours until it rises and becomes airy. After fermentation, stir the batter gently. Grease idli molds, pour the batter into the molds, and steam for 10-15 minutes until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Remove the idlis from the molds and serve hot with chutney and sambar.';

To prepare, first, cook 1 cup of toor dal in a pressure cooker with 2-3 cups of water until soft, then mash it well. In a pan, heat oil and saut√© mustard seeds, curry leaves, dried red chilies, and asafoetida. Add chopped onions, tomatoes, and vegetables like carrots, drumsticks, and eggplant, and cook for a few minutes. Add tamarind pulp, 1-2 tablespoons of sambar powder, salt, and water. Let it simmer until the vegetables are tender. Finally, mix in the mashed dal, bring it to a boil, and adjust the seasoning.
